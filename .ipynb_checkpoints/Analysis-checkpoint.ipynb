    "## Introduction\n",
    "I am interested in looking at the effect COVID-19 had on the general mental health of the United states population. I am specifically interested in the first three months of COVID, when everyone was fairly isolated and in general everyone stayed home. These three months were a time of change for a large population of people, as some lost jobs and many lost connections to friends and family. This lockdown I beleive put a lot of stressors on American people, while also giving them the space and isolation to possibly analyze their own mental health more. I think it will be interesting to look at these initial three months and see trends in mental health also regarding specific demographics, and to see if any group was disproportionately affected. "

    "## Background and Related Work\n",
    "There is a thorough amount of research that has covered the effect COVID-19 has had on people’s mental health. One study I looked into compared mental health trends of January in 2021, to the same trends in January of 2019 (https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/#:~:text=During%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic,largely%20stable%20since%20spring%202020.) This study looked much later into the pandemic than I plan to, but has interesting takeaways that discuss how symptoms of anxiety and depression rose due to the pandemic. Based on my survey data, I plan to do a data analysis similar to this article, but that focuses solely on the first three months of the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also this study done but the CDC that came out in August of 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm), which looks at the self-reports of adults mental health in June 2020. They also looked at how mental health trends affected people as broken down by different demographics, and how mental health rates tie into rising rates of substance abuse and suicide. This study was also done using survey data, and recognizies it as one of it's limitations since the data is self-reported. This is also a limiation I must acknowledge in my work, as the data I am using also was not collected by professionals. Overall, substantial research has been done into how people’s mental health has been affected during the pandemic as whole, and in my research I hope to dial into the very beginning of lockdown specifically."

    "## Research Questions and Hypotheses\n",
    "I originally wanted to look at the affect COVID-19 had on Americans, but because I did not have survey data from before the pandemic, I chose to instead focus on the first three months of the COVID-19 lockdown. The dataset I have is survey data that was collected in the United States, and so I am limiting my question to be about Americans specifically.\n",

    "To begin exploring my topic, I used the pytrends library to create some visualizations of what the trends of certain search terms looked like during 2020. I began by looking at the term \"coronavirus anxiety\", to see how the trends of anxiety related to coronavirus progressed. For this exploration, I think it’s important to point out that the scores used by Google to measure search trends are based on a scale of 1-100, representing the proportion of that term to all searches on all topics. That means that we need to take into account major U.S events that would distort this proportion, such as the Black Lives Matter movement in June 2020, west coast wildfires in mid August, death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the many other things that happened in the year 2020.

    "# Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Trend Exploration\n",
    "The google search trend data exploration showed how people continued to search out mental health help, even once quarantine began. It also showed how the trends of “coronavirus anxiety” spiked in mid march when the lockdown began, then slowly decreased as 2020 went on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data analysis in general\n",
    "The ANOVA test of metal health scores across the three months proved to not have statistical significance. This is reflected also in the distribution plot of the three datasets, as there are no visual differences between the densities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data analysis of ethnic groups\n",
    "When looking at each ethnic group individually, no relationship across the three months was shown to be statistically significant. When I ran a ANOVA test on the groups as a whole, there was a statistically significant difference between the mental health scores across ethnic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data analysis of income\n",
    "When I ran ANOVA tests on each income bracket individually, none of the brackets proved to have a statistically significant relationships across the three months. When I compared the mean mental health scores of each income bracket, there was a statistically significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discussion and Limitations\n",
    "Based on my data analysis, I could not find any statistically significant difference regarding American's reported mental health across the first three months of the COVID-19 lockdown. This I believe could be due to the short period of time that I was looking at, and possibly a lack of data in each category. On the other hand, I was able to find significance regarding mental health scores across both ethnic groups and income brackets. This significant difference you can see when you look at the visualizations, as there is a wide gap between the average days of stress and anxiety experienced by someone making more than 125k, and someone making less than 30k. \n",
    "\n",
    "To me this makes sense, as those who are lower income or who are a discriminated against minoirty group face have many stressors in their life that may put a strain on their mental health. In addition, this stress can often go untreated as they cannot afford treatment or do not have the resources to get help. Mental healthcare is not accessible to everyone in America, so it makes sense to see a significant difference between privileged/non-privileged demographics. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Analyzing the survey data informed me that while there are no trends in the data for the first three months of the COVID-19 lockdown, there are significant differences between the mental health of different ethnic groups and income brackets. The Google search trend exploration showed me that while there is no significant rise in reports of mental health disorders, people are still actively searching for mental health terms on Google. If I could do this project again I think I would like to actually see how mental health trends in America have changed over the years in regards to the pandemic, and possibly compare data from the late 2010s to reports in 2020-2022. I think I limited myself by choosing this survey dataset, but nontheless I had interesting findings regarding the differences in mental health across demographics."
